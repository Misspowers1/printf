# printf Repository by Edna and Suleiman

Welcome to our printf repository! Our goal is to provide a comprehensive implementation of the C library function `printf()`.

We have designed our repository to be easily extensible and user-friendly.

The repository consists of a library of functions which handle the output formatting and string manipulation.
